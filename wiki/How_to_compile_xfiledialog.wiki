=== Requirements ===

  * JDK 6 should be installed 
  * Visual Studio 2008 or higher (VS express version does not work)
 
=== Details ===

The following procedures work in 32 bit Windows and require command prompt. 


*Note*: If your CPU belongs to X64 (amd64, pentium 4 with EM64T, intel multi-core with EM64T) and you are using 64 bit Java/Windows, or you prefer GUI dev environment, please modify it accordingly. 


====To compile 32 bit X86 DLL ====

  * Add JDK's bin directory into the system variable "PATH" 
  * Set up the Visual stduio's environment variables 
     e.g. run the following command 
     {{{
         c:\vs2008\VC\bin\vcvars32.bat
     }}}  
  * Run compile.bat in xfiledialog's root directory. 
  * If the compilation is successful, a new file "xfiledialog.dll"will be created. 
  * Test 
     e.g. run the following command in xfiledialog's root directory
     {{{
      run.bat 
     }}}


==== To compile 64 bit X64 DLL ====

  * Add JDK's bin directory into the system variable "PATH" 
  * Set up the Visual stduio's environment variables 
     e.g. run the following command 
     {{{
       c:\vs2008\VC\bin\x86_amd64\vcvarsx86_amd64.bat
     }}}  
  * Run compile64.bat in xfiledialog's root directory. 
  * If the compilation is successful, a new file "xfiledialog64.dll"will be created. 
  * Test 
     e.g. run the following command in xfiledialog's root directory
     {{{
      run.bat 
     }}}
