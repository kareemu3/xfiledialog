*How to use XFileDialog in Java Swing*

=== Introduction ====

It's recommended to use XFileDialog to replace AWT's FileDialog. 

Since they have the same interface, a FileDialog object can be easily replaced 
with a XFileDialog object. 


=== Details ====


  * A XFileDialog object must be created in EDT thread, i.e., a XFileDialog should be defined in ActionListener functions. 
  
  * XFileDialog may not work smoothly with some third party Java LookandFeels. You can either switch to the default lookandfeels (NIMBUS,OCEAN,system) or ask their authors for technical support.
