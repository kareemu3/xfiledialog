        Read the following links if you wish to compile it yourself or modify the code. 

        Email me if you find anything wrong in XFileDialog, or figure out better implementation.

===Section 2: Implementation based on CFileDialog and IFileDialog===

===Section 3: Integration between Windows Unicode and Java Unicode=== 

       3.1 Get familiar with the confusing terminology: 
    
        * In Windows: SBCS often refers to ISO-8859-1 or ASCII charset 

        * In Windows: MBCS actually is equal to Windows "ANSI" in many cases. 

        * In Windows: Unicode actually often means UTF-16

        * Although UTF-16 is a variable-width encoding, most characters in UTF-16 actually is 2 bytes or 16bit.   

       3.2 What's Unicode

       * About windows encoding codepage

       * About charset: SBCS/MBCS/Unicode

       * UTF faq:

       * What is Charset, coded character set,  character-encoding scheme?

       * Unicode programing in Windows:
